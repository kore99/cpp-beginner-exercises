C++ Beginner Exercises
======================

These are my attempts at the C++ beginner exercises found [here](http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/articles/12974/)

Please feel free to correct some of my mistakes made in these exercises, especially Graduation. It's kind of __hard__ for me. 

Other than that, I will constantly update the projects to find more efficient ways to solve the problems! 

Happy hacking :)
